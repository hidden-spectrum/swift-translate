Swift Translate is a CLI tool and Swift Package Plugin that makes it easy to localize your app. It deconstructs your string catalogs and sends them to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model for translation. See it in action:

## 🛑 Stop Here
Before continuing, please read the following:
- This project is in very early stages. 🐣
- It is **NOT** recommended for production use. ⛔️ 
- Like any tool built on ChatGPT, responses may be inaccurate or broken completely. 🤪 
- Hidden Spectrum is not liable for loss of data, file corruption, or inaccurate/offensive translations (or any subsequent bad app reviews due to aforementioned inaccuracies) 🙅🏻‍♂️
    
**👉 Note:** By default, your catalogs *WILL NOT* be overwritten, instead a copy will be made with `.loc` extension.
If you wish to overwrite your catalogs, be sure they are checked into your repository or backed up, then use the `--overwrite` CLI argument.

Ok, with that out of the way let's get into the fun stuff...

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Option 1: Via Repo Clone
**👉 Note:** While this plugin is still in development, this is the recommended way of trying it with your projects.

1. Clone this repository or download a zip from GitHub.
2. Open terminal and `cd` to the repo on your machine.
3. Test your API key with a basic text translation:
    ```shell
    swift run swift-translate --verbose -k <your key here> --text "This is a test" --lang de
    ``` 
4. You should see the following output:

    ```shell
    Building for debugging...
    Build complete! (0.59s)

    Translating `This is a test`:
    de:      Dies ist ein Test
    ✅ Translated 1 key(s) (0.384 seconds)
    ```
5. Next, run the `--help` command to learn more:
    ```shell
    swift run swift-translate --help
    ```
    
### Option 2: Via Package Plugin

1. Add the depedency to your `Package.swift` file.
    ```swift
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hidden-spectrum/swift-translate", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
    ]
    ```
2. Add the plugin to your target:
    ```swift
    .target(
        name: "App",
        // ...
        plugins: [
            .plugin(name: "SwiftTranslate", package: "swift-translate")
        ]
    )
    ```
3. Open terminal and `cd` to your package directory.
4. Try translating a catalog in your package:
    ```shell
    swift package plugin swift-translate -k <your key here> <path/to/some/localization.xcstrings> --lang de --verbose 
    ```
5. Enter `Y` when prompted for write access to your package folder and for outgoing network connections.
6. After translation is finished, check for a new `YourFile.loc.xcstrings` file in the same directory as the original file.

### Option 3: Inside Xcode
🚧 *Not yet supported*


## 💸 A Note on Cost
The current model used in this project, GPT 3.5 Turbo, is extremely cheap. During development of this initial version we executed 3,736 API requests containing 157,734 tokens and our bill came out to just $0.26 USD 😄
